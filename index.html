		<h6>Section 2: Project Weekly Report </h6>	
		<h6 id = "pro">First task</h6>
		<p id = "title">Description: </p>
		<p>Creating a database by using AWS DynamoDB service, which will be used to store all the information of the inventory. Just like when we do it on-premise. But this time, we will leverage the cloud computing industry to build an inventory management system. Thus, if the database on-premises is crashed, or deleted in an accident, we still have it in the cloud.</p>
		<p id = "title">User story:</p>
		<p>As the only cloud computing architect in my team, I helped the team in creating a database using AWS DynamoDB to store all the information of products (car) in the cloud which will help the owner in reducing cost for maintaining an on-premise center. </p>
		<p id = "title">Completion:</p>
		<p>I finished the task. The assigned task I worked on is the database in the cloud and the result as the screenshot below. The database is called Vehicle, which is used to store all the information of a car. Whenever the user inserts, updates or deletes, it will be affected and recognized in this table. 
		</p>
		<p id = "title">On track? </p>
		<p>For now, I am on the path to finish the SPRINT because I finished my task on time and the rest as well. I believe we are all doing well and on the way there.</p>

		<h6 id = "pro">Second task</h6>
		<p id = "title">Description:</p>
		<p>Create IAM roles for all team members so we can all access the account. In this task, based on the role of each member, I will give them the permission to access the database.</p>
		<p id = "title">User story:</p>
		<p>I will use the AWS IAM service to create about 7 users. Based on the role of the members, the users are divided into 2 groups: admin and user. Each group will have a different role. Admin group will have full permission to access the database. And the user groupâ€™s permission will be limited, they are only able to read the database.</p>
		<p id = "title">Completion:</p>
		<p>I finished the task. I already set up the roles for all team members. All related documents I work on are on the AWS as the provided screenshot below.</p>		
		<p id = "title">On track? </p>
		<p>For now, I am on the path to finish the SPRINT because I already finished my task on time and the rest as well. I believe we are all doing well and on the way there because we are not only building projects on-premise but also in the cloud at the same time.</p>
